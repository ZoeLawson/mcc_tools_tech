Julio Madrid's First ReStructuredText Homework
========================================

This is my first experience with reStructured text!

What is reStructuredText?
--------------------------

**reStructuredText** is plain text markup syntax and parser system. Below is an example of reStructuredText written in the Online Sphinx editor: 

Insert white space between lines of text to seperate paragraphs.

Use asterisks or dashes to insert items in an unordered list:

* Here is a bullet point entered by using an asterisk. 
- Here is another bullet point entered by using a dash; asterisks and dashes are interchangeable in the editor.

If I wanted to include a quote, I would simply use indentation to separate it from "normal" text:
              
 *"Water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend." - Bruce Lee*

How is reStructuredText Useful?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
restructuredText is useful for in-line documentation, for quickly creating simple webpages, and for standalone documents. 

**Primary Objective**

  to define and implement a markup syntax for use in Python docstrings that is accessible and yet powerful enough for non-trivial use.

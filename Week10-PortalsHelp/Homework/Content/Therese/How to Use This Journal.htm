        <p>This journal is YOUR tool.  I have included many options of information to record, but just because it’s there, doesn’t mean you have to use it.  Record what is important to your health.  Record what is requested by your health and medical practitioners.  Ignore the rest.  </p>
        <p>You may find you want to focus on different areas at different times.  Do it!</p>
        <p>Be as consistent as you can in making your daily recordings.  That way, you will have the information that you and your health team need to help you on your journey to better health!</p>

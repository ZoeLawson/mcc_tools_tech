        <h3 class="Heading3">Pain Scale</h3>
        <p>The use of a pain scale is meant to make the description of pain “objective”.&#160; It is difficult for someone contending with chronic pain to be accurate because you may have developed coping mechanisms or a tolerance for pain.&#160; Pain, which is very subjective, is also affected by fatigue, stress, trigger points, sensitivity to stimuli, etc.</p>
        <p>The pain scale below is an example.&#160; In addition to giving the number, define to the doctor what that number means to you.&#160; For example, what is a <span class="span_1">6</span> for you, the doctor may think is an <span class="span_1">8</span> with additional description.&#160; Pain is very relative.&#160; Know that individuals may report different severities of pain for the same types of injuries, making the doctor’s job challenging.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Ref451851689"></a>Mankoski Pain Scale</h3>
        <p>This scale was developed by Andrea Mankoski in 1995<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p class="FootnoteText"> Pain scale adapted from the scale posted on http://www.ChronicallyAwesome.org</p></MadCap:footnote>.&#160; It is a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest level of pain.&#160; This scale is meant to describe the ability to function in your whole life.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Describing symptoms</h2>
        <p>Give Health Practitioners enough detail to understand your symptoms.  When you say something like, “I’m tired” the health practitioner is imagining how they feel when they are tired.  What do you mean by tired?&#160; </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Example of a Good Description:</h3>
        <p>“I am so tired that I have difficulty getting out of bed, I usually require 2 one-hour naps each day, and I go to bed at 9:30 pm.  I average 9 hours of sleep a night but never feel refreshed.  This seems to have started about two months ago after a camping trip.  I have tried adjusting my bedtime routines but it hasn’t helped.  I am most tired in the morning and drink three cups of coffee in order to feel like I’m awake.  By mid-morning, I’m so tired I need to lay down to take a nap.  This happens again around 3 or 4 in the afternoon”</p>

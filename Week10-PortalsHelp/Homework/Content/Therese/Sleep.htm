        <h1 class="Heading1">Sleep</h1>
        <p>Spend a few minutes (before you go to sleep and when you wake up) briefly answering the following questions.&#160; Do this each night and morning until you notice a pattern – usually a week.  The aim is to measure the pattern and quality of your sleep, and factors that may affect your sleep.  These can be recorded or noted in the Daily Record.</p>

        <h1>Julio Madrid's First MadCap Flare Project</h1>
        <p>Hello, welcome to my first MadCap Flare project!</p>
        <h2><cite>What is MadCap Flare?</cite>
        </h2>
        <p>MadCap Flare is a content management application used to create, manage, and publish content in a variety of formats and devices.</p>
        <h3><cite>Why Do Technical Writers Use MadCap Flare?</cite>
        </h3>
        <p>Here are two reasons, among many, technical writers and documentation teams use MadCap Flare:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p> <b>Flexibility:</b> Flare has  features that make writing content more flexible. For example, you can click-and-drag the XML structure bars (the bars on the left-hand side of the XML Editor) to rearrange the order of content in the document. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Reusable:</b>Single sourcing features like conditions and variables foster content reuse. No longer do you have to manually edit changes to your documentation. Simply use the single source tools available and changes are made automatically. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For more information, here is a video presentation on the various features included with MadCap Flare:</p>

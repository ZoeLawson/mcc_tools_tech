    <shortdesc>The Laser D project involves transferring millions of corporate document files from
        thousands of discs.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Here are some things about the Laser D project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The primary goal of the Laser D project is to extract and index corporate document
                files from a libraryâ€™s Laser D collection within 9-12 months. </li>
            <li> These files must be transferred from compact discs (CDs) and saved
                electronically.</li>
            <li>The Laser D collection contains U.S and international public company reports from
                filing public companies. </li>
            <li>MBA students need these reports for their academic research, but these documents are
                in danger of erasure due to the obsolescence of their media and software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upon completion of this project, graduate students will have access to the entire
            collection of reports.</p>
